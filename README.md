# cool-rad-hip-map

Here is my cool new map.  
All you have to do is search for your favorite restaurant, 
click one of the icons on the map,
and then information about number of foursquare checkins, 
health rating from the nyc health office,
foursquare rating,
and if you can reserve a table online from opentable will be displayed on the left side.
On the right side, you can see the address of the restaurant, 
along with a button to add it to your favorites list.
You can register or login to save your favorites.

For this project, I used jQuery, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Material Design, Vue JS, VueFire, and Firebase.
